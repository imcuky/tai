                    ### Part 1: Extract Key Concepts 
                    Your goal is to create a high-level summary of the entire document by identifying a small, curated set of its most important concepts. This should serve as a "big picture" overview for a student.
                    CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS - YOU MUST FOLLOW:
                    1.  **Strict One-to-One Mapping (Most Important):** The relationship between a Source Section and a Key Concept must be strictly one-to-one. Each chosen Source Section title MUST map to exactly ONE Key Concept. It is forbidden to generate multiple Key Concepts from the same single Source Section.
                    2.  **Limited Quantity:** Your most important task is to aggressively merge and consolidate topics. Actively seek to unify related ideas under a single, overarching key concept. Before creating a new concept, you must first determine if its core idea can be logically absorbed by another. The final output must represent the absolute minimum number of concepts possible, and the count must always be less than 5.
                    3.  **No Hierarchical Overlap:** If you choose a main section title (e.g., "Chapter 1"), you cannot also choose one of its sub-sections (e.g., "Section 1.1").
                    4.  **Concise Concepts:** The key concept should be a single, descriptive sentence that captures the main idea of the entire section block.
                    5.  **Preserve Original Order:** The Key Concept objects must appear in the same order as their corresponding Source Sections appear in the original markdown. Do not reorder, merge across, or reshuffle the sequence.
                    6.  **Generate Follow-up Check-in Question:** For each key concept, you must create an `check_in_question` object. This object is designed to test a student's deep understanding of the concept.
                        -   **Challenging Nature:** The question must be difficult. It should require **application, analysis, or synthesis** of the information from the section, not just simple recall.
                        -   **Plausible Distractors:** The incorrect options should be plausible and target common student misconceptions related to the topic.
                        -   **Structure:** The `check_in_question` object must contain the following four fields:
                            -   `question_text`: (String) The full text of the multiple-choice question.
                            -   `options`: (Array of Strings) An array containing exactly four possible answers.
                            -   `correct_answer`: (Array of Integers) The indices of the correct options in the options array, e.g. [0,1] for the first and second options.
                            -   `explanation`: (String) A detailed explanation describing why the correct answer is right and why the other options are incorrect.
                    For each concept you extract, provide ONLY the following information:
                    Key Concept: [A single, clear sentence summarizing the core idea of the section.]
                    Source Section: [The single, exact title from title_list that this concept is derived from.]
                    Check-in Question: The structured question object as defined above.

                    ### Part 2: Extract and Create Problems
                    If you find there are some blocks named Exercise or Challenge, then based on the key concepts you identified, create educational problems that test student understanding. 
                    If there are no such blocks, skip this part.
                    For each problem:
                    - **ID:** Identify if this relates to an existing exercise in the material (e.g., "Exercise 1", "Challenge 1")
                    - **Content:** Provide the main problem statement or scenario
                    - **Sub-problems:** Create exactly 2 sub-problems for each main problem:
                      - Each sub-problem should be a multiple choice question
                      - Options should include relevant key concepts from the material
                      - Provide clear explanations for correct answers
                      - Sub-problems should test different aspects or depths of understanding of the main concept

                    ### Part 3: Generate Comprehensive Recap Questions
                    Create up to 5 recap questions (0–5, only include questions that are genuinely meaningful). These questions are for review and self-check, not extension. They must help students recall and consolidate the document's key concepts and verify whether they understand what the file/lecture teaches.

                    Design principles:
                    - **Recap, not add-on:** Do not introduce content beyond the document. Use the document's terminology and scope.
                    - **Coverage with minimal redundancy:** Collectively touch the main themes; avoid overlapping questions.
                    - **Easy → Moderate:** Questions should be easy to moderate. If multiple questions are produced, order them from easier to slightly more integrative.
                    - **Concept integration (lightweight):** Prefer questions that connect 2–3 core ideas from different sections to reinforce recall, but keep cognitive load reasonable.

                    For each recap question:
                    - **Question Type:** Classify as recap
                    - **Multiple Choice:** Provide exactly 4 options with 1-2 correct answers
                    - **Clear Explanation:** Detail why correct answers are right and others wrong
                    - **Knowledge Areas:** List the key knowledge areas being tested

                    ### Guidelines:
                    - Focus on the most important concepts that students need to understand
                    - Ensure all content is directly derived from the provided markdown material
                    - Make problems challenging but fair, testing true comprehension
                    - Use key concepts as both correct answers and plausible distractors in multiple choice options
                    - Provide detailed explanations that reference the source material

        f""" You are an expert AI assistant specializing in analyzing and structuring educational material. You will be given markdown content from a video in the course "{course_name}", from the file "{file_name}". The text is already divided into paragraphs. Your task is to perform the following actions and format the output as a single JSON object.
        The final JSON object must contain two top-level keys: `sections` and `key_concepts`.
        ### Part 1: Structure the Content
        Analyze the entire text and structure it within the `sections` key.
        1.  **Group into Sections:** Divide the entire text into 3-5 logical sections.
        2.  **Generate Titles:**
            -   For each **section**, create a concise and descriptive title.
            -   For each **original paragraph**, create an engaging title that reflects its main topic.
        3.  **Create a Nested Structure:** The `sections` key must contain an array of section objects.
            -   Each section object must contain a `title` and a nested `paragraphs` array.
            -   Each paragraph object within the nested array must include its `title` and its `original_index` from the source text (starting from 1).
        ### Part 2: Extract Key Concepts and Create Assessments
        Based on the sections you defined in Part 1, distill the core learning points and create a corresponding assessment question for each. This will be structured under the `key_concepts` key.
        1.  **Strict One-to-One Mapping (Most Important):** The relationship between a Source Section and a Key Concept object must be strictly one-to-one. Each Source Section title from Part 1 MUST map to exactly ONE object in the `key_concepts` array.
        2.  **Limited Quantity:** Aggressively merge and consolidate topics. The final output must represent the absolute minimum number of concepts possible, and the count must always be less than 5.
        3.  **Concise Concepts:** The `key_concept` value should be a single, descriptive sentence that captures the main idea of the entire section.
        4.  **Preserve Original Order:** The Key Concept objects must appear in the same order as their corresponding Source Sections appear in Part 1.
        5.  **Generate Follow-up Check-in Question:** For each key concept, you must create an `check_in_question` object. This object is designed to test a student's deep understanding of the concept.
            -   **Challenging Nature:** The question must be difficult. It should require **application, analysis, or synthesis** of the information from the section, not just simple recall.
            -   **Plausible Distractors:** The incorrect options should be plausible and target common student misconceptions related to the topic.
            -   **Structure:** The `check_in_question` object must contain the following four fields:
                -   `question_text`: (String) The full text of the multiple-choice question.
                -   `options`: (Array of Strings) An array containing exactly four possible answers.
                -   `correct_answer`: (String) The exact text of the correct option.
                -   `explanation`: (String) A detailed explanation describing why the correct answer is right and why the other options are incorrect.
        For each concept you extract, provide an object in the `key_concepts` array with the following structure:
        -   `key_concept`: [A single, clear sentence summarizing the core idea of the section.]
        -   `source_section`: [The single, exact title from the section that this concept is derived from.]
        -   `check_in_question`:The structured question object as defined above.
        ### Part 3: Generate Comprehensive Recap Questions
        Create up to 5 recap questions (0–5, only include questions that are genuinely meaningful). These questions are for review and self-check, not extension. They must help students recall and consolidate the document's key concepts and verify whether they understand what the file/lecture teaches.

        Design principles:
        - **Recap, not add-on:** Do not introduce content beyond the document. Use the document's terminology and scope.
        - **Coverage with minimal redundancy:** Collectively touch the main themes; avoid overlapping questions.
        - **Easy → Moderate:** Questions should be easy to moderate. If multiple questions are produced, order them from easier to slightly more integrative.
        - **Concept integration (lightweight):** Prefer questions that connect 2–3 core ideas from different sections to reinforce recall, but keep cognitive load reasonable.

        For each recap question:
        - **Question Type:** Classify as recap
        - **Multiple Choice:** Provide exactly 4 options with 1-2 correct answers
        - **Clear Explanation:** Detail why correct answers are right and others wrong
        - **Knowledge Areas:** List the key knowledge areas being tested

        ### Part 4: Identify and Classify Speakers
        The markdown includes speaker tags like Speaker_00, Speaker_01, etc. For each unique speaker:
        - Analyze their content and determine the most likely role:
            - "Professor" (teaching and explaining concepts, authoritative tone) - ONLY ONE ALLOWED
            - "Teaching Assistant" (supporting explanations, grading references, guiding students) 
            - "Student" (asking questions, expressing confusion, providing opinions)
            - "Unknown" (insufficient information)
        
        IMPORTANT NUMBERING RULES:
        - Only ONE speaker can be "Professor" (the main instructor)
        - Teaching Assistants should be numbered: "TA_1", "TA_2", "TA_3", etc.
        - Students should be numbered: "Student_1", "Student_2", "Student_3", etc.
        - Unknown speakers should be numbered: "Unknown_1", "Unknown_2", etc.
        - If there are multiple speakers who seem like professors, designate the most authoritative one as "Professor" and others as "TA_1", "TA_2", etc.
        
        Include these mappings in the JSON under a top-level key `speakers`. Each speaker must have:
        - `speaker_id` (e.g., "Speaker_00")
        - `role` (properly numbered according to rules above)
        """)

            f""" You are an expert AI assistant specializing in analyzing and structuring 
            educational material. You will be given markdown content from a video in the course "{course_name}", 
            from the file "{file_name}". The text is already divided into paragraphs. Your task is to perform the 
            following actions and format the output as a single JSON object: 
            ### Part 1: Structure the Content
            **Generate Titles:** - For each pargraph, create only one concise and descriptive title that reflects its main topic. 
            ### Part 2: Extract Key Concepts and Create Assessments
            Based on the paragraphs you defined in Part 1, distill the core learning points and create a corresponding assessment question for each. This will be structured under the `key_concepts` key.
            1.  **Strict One-to-One Mapping (Most Important):** The relationship between a Source Section and a Key Concept object must be strictly one-to-one. Each Source Section title from Part 1 MUST map to exactly ONE object in the `key_concepts` array.
            2.  **Limited Quantity:** Aggressively merge and consolidate topics. The final output must represent the absolute minimum number of concepts possible, and the count must always be less than 5.
            3.  **Concise Concepts:** The `key_concept` value should be a single, descriptive sentence that captures the main idea of the entire section.
            4.  **Preserve Original Order:** The Key Concept objects must appear in the same order as their corresponding Source Sections appear in Part 1.
            5.  **Generate Follow-up Check-in Question:** For each key concept, you must create an `check_in_question` object. This object is designed to test a student's deep understanding of the concept.
                -   **Challenging Nature:** The question must be difficult. It should require **application, analysis, or synthesis** of the information from the section, not just simple recall.
                -   **Plausible Distractors:** The incorrect options should be plausible and target common student misconceptions related to the topic.
                -   **Structure:** The `check_in_question` object must contain the following four fields:
                    -   `question_text`: (String) The full text of the multiple-choice question.
                    -   `options`: (Array of Strings) An array containing exactly four possible answers.
                    -   `correct_answer`: The index of the option in the options array, e.g. [0,1] for the first and second options
                    -   `explanation`: (String) A detailed explanation describing why the correct answer is right and why the other options are incorrect.
            For each concept you extract, provide an object in the `key_concepts` array with the following structure:
            -   `key_concept`: [A single, clear sentence summarizing the core idea of the section.]
            -   `source_section`: [The single, exact title from the section that this concept is derived from.]
            -   `check_in_question`:The structured question object as defined above.
            ### Part 3: Generate Comprehensive Recap Questions
            Create up to 5 recap questions (0–5, only include questions that are genuinely meaningful). These questions are for review and self-check, not extension. They must help students recall and consolidate the document's key concepts and verify whether they understand what the file/lecture teaches.

            Design principles:
            - **Recap, not add-on:** Do not introduce content beyond the document. Use the document's terminology and scope.
            - **Coverage with minimal redundancy:** Collectively touch the main themes; avoid overlapping questions.
            - **Easy → Moderate:** Questions should be easy to moderate. If multiple questions are produced, order them from easier to slightly more integrative.
            - **Concept integration (lightweight):** Prefer questions that connect 2–3 core ideas from different sections to reinforce recall, but keep cognitive load reasonable.

            For each recap question:
            - **Question Type:** Classify as recap
            - **Multiple Choice:** Provide exactly 4 options with 1-2 correct answers
            - **Clear Explanation:** Detail why correct answers are right and others wrong
            - **Knowledge Areas:** List the key knowledge areas being tested

             ### Part 4: Identify and Classify Speakers
            The markdown includes speaker tags like Speaker_00, Speaker_01, etc. For each unique speaker:
            - FIRST: Look for name introductions in their speech (e.g., "I am John", "My name is Sarah", "I'm Professor Smith")
            - If a name is found, use the actual name as the speaker identifier
            - If no name is found, analyze their content and determine the most likely role:
                - "Professor" (teaching and explaining concepts, authoritative tone) - ONLY ONE ALLOWED
                - "Teaching Assistant" (supporting explanations, grading references, guiding students)
                - "Student" (asking questions, expressing confusion, providing opinions)
                - "Unknown" (insufficient information)

            NAME DETECTION PATTERNS (prioritize these):
            - "I am [Name]" or "I'm [Name]"
            - "My name is [Name]"
            - "This is [Name]"
            - "I'm Professor/Dr. [Name]"
            - "[Name] speaking" or "[Name] here"

            FALLBACK NUMBERING RULES (only if no names found):
            - Only ONE speaker can be "Professor" (the main instructor)
            - Teaching Assistants should be numbered: "TA_1", "TA_2", "TA_3", etc.
            - Students should be numbered: "Student_1", "Student_2", "Student_3", etc.
            - Unknown speakers should be numbered: "Unknown_1", "Unknown_2", etc.
            - If there are multiple speakers who seem like professors, designate the most authoritative one as "Professor" and others as "TA_1", "TA_2", etc.

            Include these mappings in the JSON under a top-level key `speakers`. Each speaker must have:
            - `speaker_id` (e.g., "Speaker_00")
            - `role` (actual name if detected, otherwise properly numbered role according to rules above)""")

                be given markdown content from the file "{file_name}" for the course "{course_name}". Your task is to 
                analyze this content and produce a structured JSON output. The task has two parts: title structuring 
                and key concept extraction. 
                ### Part 1: Adjust Title Hierarchy Levels
                **Your Goal:** Given the title list, determine the correct semantic hierarchy level for each title based on their logical relationship and content structure.
                **CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS - MUST FOLLOW:**
                - Use EXACTLY the titles from title_list - no additions, no modifications
                - Output title text WITHOUT any '#' symbols 
                - If a title in the list has '#' symbols, remove them completely
                - Do NOT create any new titles that aren't in the provided list
                - Do NOT include any text that doesn't appear in {title_list}
                **FORBIDDEN - Do NOT do these:**
                ❌ Adding titles not in the list
                ❌ Including # symbols
                ❌ Modifying title text in any way
                **Maintain Logical Flow:** Each title's level should make sense relative to the titles before and after it
                ### Part 2: Extract High-Level Key Concepts for Overview
                Your goal is to create a high-level summary of the entire document by identifying a small, curated set of its most important concepts. This should serve as a "big picture" overview for a student.
                CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS - YOU MUST FOLLOW:
                1.  **Strict One-to-One Mapping (Most Important):** The relationship between a Source Section and a Key Concept must be strictly one-to-one. Each chosen Source Section title MUST map to exactly ONE Key Concept. It is forbidden to generate multiple Key Concepts from the same single Source Section.
                2.  **Limited Quantity:** Your most important task is to aggressively merge and consolidate topics. Actively seek to unify related ideas under a single, overarching key concept. Before creating a new concept, you must first determine if its core idea can be logically absorbed by another. The final output must represent the absolute minimum number of concepts possible, and the count must always be less than 5.
                3.  **No Hierarchical Overlap:** If you choose a main section title (e.g., "Chapter 1"), you cannot also choose one of its sub-sections (e.g., "Section 1.1").
                4.  **Concise Concepts:** The key concept should be a single, descriptive sentence that captures the main idea of the entire section block.
                5.  **Preserve Original Order** Key Concepts must appear in the same order as their corresponding Source Sections appear in the original markdown.Do not reorder, merge across, or reshuffle the sequence.
                6.  **Generate Follow-up Check-in Question:** For each key concept, you must create an `check_in_question` object. This object is designed to test a student's deep understanding of the concept.
                    -   **Challenging Nature:** The question must be difficult. It should require **application, analysis, or synthesis** of the information from the section, not just simple recall.
                    -   **Plausible Distractors:** The incorrect options should be plausible and target common student misconceptions related to the topic.
                    -   **Structure:** The `check_in_question` object must contain the following four fields:
                        -   `question_text`: (String) The full text of the multiple-choice question.
                        -   `options`: (Array of Strings) An array containing exactly four possible answers.
                        -   `correct_answer`: (Array of Integers) The indices of the correct options in the options array, e.g. [0,1] for the first and second options.
                        -   `explanation`: (String) A detailed explanation describing why the correct answer is right and why the other options are incorrect.
                For each concept you extract, provide ONLY the following information:
                Key Concept: [A single, clear sentence summarizing the core idea of the section.]
                Source Section: [The single, exact title from {title_list} that this concept is derived from.]
                Check-in Question: The structured question object as defined above.

                ### Part 3: Generate Comprehensive Recap Questions
                Create up to 5 recap questions (0–5, only include questions that are genuinely meaningful). These questions are for review and self-check, not extension. They must help students recall and consolidate the document's key concepts and verify whether they understand what the file/lecture teaches.

                Design principles:
                - **Recap, not add-on:** Do not introduce content beyond the document. Use the document's terminology and scope.
                - **Coverage with minimal redundancy:** Collectively touch the main themes; avoid overlapping questions.
                - **Easy → Moderate:** Questions should be easy to moderate. If multiple questions are produced, order them from easier to slightly more integrative.
                - **Concept integration (lightweight):** Prefer questions that connect 2–3 core ideas from different sections to reinforce recall, but keep cognitive load reasonable.

                For each recap question:
                - **Question Type:** Classify as recap
                - **Multiple Choice:** Provide exactly 4 options with 1-2 correct answers
                - **Clear Explanation:** Detail why correct answers are right and others wrong
                - **Knowledge Areas:** List the key knowledge areas being tested""")

                f"""Extract High-Level Key Concepts for Overview
                Your goal is to create a high-level summary of the entire document by identifying a small, curated set of its most important concepts. This should serve as a "big picture" overview for a student.
                CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS - YOU MUST FOLLOW:
                1.  **Strict One-to-One Mapping (Most Important):** The relationship between a Source Section and a Key Concept must be strictly one-to-one. Each chosen Source Section title MUST map to exactly ONE Key Concept. It is forbidden to generate multiple Key Concepts from the same single Source Section.
                2.  **Limited Quantity:** Your most important task is to aggressively merge and consolidate topics. Actively seek to unify related ideas under a single, overarching key concept. Before creating a new concept, you must first determine if its core idea can be logically absorbed by another. The final output must represent the absolute minimum number of concepts possible, and the count must always be less than 5.
                3.  **No Hierarchical Overlap:** If you choose a main section title (e.g., "Chapter 1"), you cannot also choose one of its sub-sections (e.g., "Section 1.1").
                4.  **Concise Concepts:** The key concept should be a single, descriptive sentence that captures the main idea of the entire section block.                
                5.  **Preserve Original Order** Key Concepts must appear in the same order as their corresponding Source Sections appear in the original markdown.Do not reorder, merge across, or reshuffle the sequence.
                6.  **Generate Follow-up Check-in Question:** For each key concept, you must create an `check_in_question` object. This object is designed to test a student's deep understanding of the concept.
                    -   **Challenging Nature:** The question must be difficult. It should require **application, analysis, or synthesis** of the information from the section, not just simple recall.
                    -   **Plausible Distractors:** The incorrect options should be plausible and target common student misconceptions related to the topic.
                    -   **Structure:** The `check_in_question` object must contain the following four fields:
                        -   `question_text`: (String) The full text of the multiple-choice question.
                        -   `options`: (Array of Strings) An array containing exactly four possible answers.
                        -   `correct_answer`: (Array of Integers) The indices of the correct options in the options array, e.g. [0,1] for the first and second options.
                        -   `explanation`: (String) A detailed explanation describing why the correct answer is right and why the other options are incorrect.
                For each concept you extract, provide ONLY the following information:
                Key Concept: [A single, clear sentence summarizing the core idea of the section.]
                Source Section: [The single, exact title from {title_list} that this concept is derived from.]
                Check-in Question: The structured question object as defined above.

                ### Generate Comprehensive Recap Questions
                Create up to 5 recap questions (0–5, only include questions that are genuinely meaningful). These questions are for review and self-check, not extension. They must help students recall and consolidate the document's key concepts and verify whether they understand what the file/lecture teaches.

                Design principles:
                - **Recap, not add-on:** Do not introduce content beyond the document. Use the document's terminology and scope.
                - **Coverage with minimal redundancy:** Collectively touch the main themes; avoid overlapping questions.
                - **Easy → Moderate:** Questions should be easy to moderate. If multiple questions are produced, order them from easier to slightly more integrative.
                - **Concept integration (lightweight):** Prefer questions that connect 2–3 core ideas from different sections to reinforce recall, but keep cognitive load reasonable.

                For each recap question:
                - **Question Type:** Classify as recap
                - **Multiple Choice:** Provide exactly 4 options with 1-2 correct answers
                - **Clear Explanation:** Detail why correct answers are right and others wrong
                - **Knowledge Areas:** List the key knowledge areas being tested""")
